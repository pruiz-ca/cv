\begin{cvparagraph}
  I'm an engineer with experience in data and consumer behaviour. Computers have always been my passion, that's why I decided to join 42 Madrid and become a developer.
  This has been a process in a disrupting school founded in Paris based on peer to peer learning and self-education, methods with which I identify myself and that I used in other important aspects of my life.
  My goal now is to advance as a professional in the field being part of a team where I can dedicate and contribute with my high motivation and work ethics.
