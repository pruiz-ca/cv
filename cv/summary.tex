  Hi! I'm Pedro. Oficially I'm an agricultural engineer with experience in data and consumer behaviour but computers have always amazed me, that's why I decided to trust my gut and become a developer.
  Big part of my learning process has been self-education either online or in 42, which is a disrupting school founded in Paris based on peer to peer learning without teachers.
  Now I want to grow as a professional and I'm ready to join and be part of a team.
  I'm powered by motivation, work and perseverance, which to me, are characteristics more valuable in a person than any diploma.
